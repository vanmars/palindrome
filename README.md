# _Palindrome_

_23 September 2020_

#### _A program that checks for palindromes_

#### By _**Vanessa Stewart**_

## Description

_This is a project for Epicodus to practice Ruby methods. The original directions are as follows:_

A palindrome is any word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters which reads the same backward or forward. Create a method to identify if a word is a palindrome.

The hard way: Create the method without using the reverse() method.

Bonus points: Make your method check a string of words and also an Integer.

Extra credit: Create a script that can scan a .txt file to see if it includes any palindromes. Your script can return the total number of palindromes (a tally) plus the actual palindromes in the script.

## Specifications
| Spec     | Behavior | Input    | Output   |
| -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- |
| 1 | Program returns true if the given word is a palindrome. | mom | true |
| 2 | Program returns true if the given integer is a palindrome. | 2662 | true |
| 3 | Program scans a text and lists all palindromes. | Mom has her eye on that racecar. | There are three palindromes: Mom, eye, racecar |
